SPID/CIE OIDC Federation is a suite of Django applications designed to
make it easy to build an [Openid Connect Federation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html), 
each of these can be installed separately within a django project, these are:

- __spid_cie_oidc.accounts__: customizable app that extended the Django User model.
- __spid_cie_oidc.entity__: OIDC Federation django app, with models and API that implements OIDC Federation 1.0 Entity Statements, metadata discovery, Trust Chain, Trust Marks and Metadata policy.
- __spid_cie_oidc.authority__: OIDC Federation API and models for Trust Anchors and Intermediaries.
- __spid_cie_oidc.onboarding__: OIDC Federation OnBoarding demo application.
- __spid_cie_oidc.relying_party__: OIDC Relying Party and test suite for OIDC Providers.
- __spid_cie_oidc.provider__: OIDC Provider and test suite for OIDC Relying Parties.

The Technical specifications of these SDKs are available here:

1. [__OIDC Federation Entity/Authority/Intermediary__](docs/technical_specifications/ENTITY.md)
2. [__OIDC Federation 1.0 onboarding service DEMO__](docs/technical_specifications/ONBOARDING.md)
3. [__Openid Connect Provider__](docs/technical_specifications/PROVIDER.md)
4. [__Openid Connect Relying Party__](docs/technical_specifications/RELYING_PARTY.md)

## Contents

We have all the Django apps available in the folder `spid_cie_oidc/`.
The examples projects are instead in the folder `examples/`.

There is a substantial difference between an app and a project.
The app is installed using a common python package manager, such as _poetry_ or _pip_,
and can be used, inherited, and integrated into other projects.

A project is a service configuration that integrates one or more applications.
In this repository we have three example projects for demo purpose.

## Setup

The Database storage engine can be one of which supported by Django, the example project comes with sqlite3.


#### Dependencies
````
apt install python3-dev python3-pip git
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo pip install virtualenv
````

Activate the environment. It's optional and up to you if you want to install 
in a separate env or system wide
````
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
````

#### Install as Django application
Install __spid-cie-oidc__ as python package and use it in your django project
````
pip install spid-cie-oidc

# then include `spid_cie_oidc.{app_name}` in your project settings.INSTALLED_APPS
````

#### Setup the example project for demo purpose

````
git clone https://github.com/peppelinux/spid-cie-oidc-django
cd spid-cie-oidc
pip install -e .
````

In `examples/` folder you have three demostrations projects:
 - federation_authority
 - relying_party
 - provider

for each of the them you have to create the db and load the example data, as follows:

````
cd examples/$project_name
cp $project_name/settingslocal.py.example $project_name/settingslocal.py

# then customize (optional) $project_name/settingslocal.py
# add OIDCFED_FEDERATION_TRSUT_ANCHORS = ["http://127.0.0.1:8000"]

./manage.py migrate

# load the demo configuration
./manage.py loaddata dumps/example.json

# create a super user
./manage.py createsuperuser
````

## Usage

The demo propose a small federation composed by the following entities:

 - Federation Authority, acts as trust anchor and onboarding system. It's available at `http://localhost:8000`
 - OpenID Relying Party, available at `http://localhost:8001`
 - OpenID Provider, available at `http://localhost:8002`


### Docker compose

> TODO: Not available untile v0.6.0 release


### Django projects

Activate the environment
````
source env/bin/activate
cd examples
````

Install Django Bootstrap italia template
````
pip install design-django-theme
````

Then enter in the single applications projects (__federation_authority/__ or __relying_party/__ or __provider/__):
````
# run the web server
./manage.py runserver
````
Point your web browser to `http://localhost:8000/admin` to enter in the management interface.


## Contribute

#### Hints

Backup your demo data

````
# backup your data (upgrade example data), -e excludes.

## Implementation notes

All the operation related to JWT signature and encryption, and part of OIDC messages operations, 
are built on top of [IdentityPython](https://idpy.org/):

- [oidcmsg](https://github.com/IdentityPython/JWTConnect-Python-OidcMsg)
- [cryptojwt](https://github.com/IdentityPython/JWTConnect-Python-CryptoJWT)

This project proposes an implementation of the italian OIDC Federation profile with
__automatic_client_registration__ and the adoption of the trust marks as mandatory.

If you're looking for a fully compliant implementation of OIDC Federation 1.0,
with a full support of explicit client registration, please look at idpy's
[fedservice](https://github.com/rohe/fedservice).
